## Overview
This project I considered as a learning process for a lot of things which I have learned recently like SCSS, modular approach to web design, following sass guidelines and a few others. This project was nice to experiment with my learnings as the project is a very simple block and I am able to focus on the guidelines, modularity and architecture of web development.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
